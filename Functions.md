### Call back functions
Callback functions are a fundamental concept in javascript which allow to pass another function as an argument. The function which receives the another function as an argument calls it in later point of time.
#### Here's how callback functions work
1. Create a function which performs some specific task.
2. When calling another function, pass this first function(the callback) as an argument.
3. The function called receives the first function as an argument and then executes the callback at later point of time.
   It may happen
   
     **a. After receiving function finishes its task.**
     
     **b. When an event occurs and triggers the call back function.**
